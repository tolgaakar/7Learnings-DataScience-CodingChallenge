# 7Learnings DataScience Coding Challenge Solution

My solution for the data science coding challenge by 7Learnings.

This repository contains a jupyter notebook with the solution for the coding challenge consisting of 2 parts. You can also find the data I used to train the models in `7L_Coding_Challenge_data_small.csv`, as well as the model files. Please refer to `7L_Coding_Challenge.ipynb` notebook for the detailed explanation of the solution.
